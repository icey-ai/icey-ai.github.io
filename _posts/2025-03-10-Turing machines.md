# Chapter 1. Models of computation
<!-- TODO: ADD some intros -->
## 1.1 Turing Machines
A **Turing Machine** (we will use **TM** in short) is a theoretical computational model introduced by Alan Turing in 1936. It is used to define the limits of what can be computed and serves as a foundation for theoretical computer science.
*Definition*:
A TM, \(M\), is a 7 tuple \((Q, \sigma)\)
