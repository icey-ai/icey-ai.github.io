# Chapter 1. Models of computation

## 1.1 Turing Machines
### 1.1.1 Definitions
A **Turing Machine** (we will use **TM** in short) is a theoretical computational model introduced by Alan Turing in 1936. It is used to define the limits of what can be computed and serves as a foundation for theoretical computer science.

---

*Definition*:
A TM, \(M\), is a tuple \((\Gamma, Q, \delta)\) which is defined as
  - A set \( \Gamma \) of the symbols that \( M \)'s tapes can contain. We assume that \( \Gamma \) contains a designated “blank” symbol, denoted \( \square \), a designated “start” symbol, denoted \( \triangleright \) and the numbers 0 and 1. We call \( \Gamma \) the *alphabet* of \( M \).
  - A set \( Q \) of possible states \( M \)'s register can be in. We assume that \( Q \) contains a designated start state, denoted \( q_{\text{start}} \) and a designated halting state, denoted \( q_{\text{halt}} \). *Note: the states in this definition refers to the state of the whole machine. Sometimes, we may also use the word configuration to mean the same thing.*
  - A function \(\delta: Q \times \Gamma^k \to Q \times \Gamma^k \times \{\text{L, S, R}\}^k\) describing the rule \( M \) uses in performing each step. This function is called the *transition function* of \( M \).
  
---

All tapes except for the input are initialized in their first location to the *start* symbol \( \triangleright \) and in all other locations to the *blank* symbol \( \square \). The input tape contains initially the start symbol \( \triangleright \), a finite non-blank string (``the input''), and the rest of its cells are initialized with the blank symbol \( \square \). All heads start at the left ends of the tapes and the machine is in the special starting state \( q_{\text{start}} \). This is called the *start configuration* of \( M \) on input \( x \). Each step of the computation is performed by applying the function \( \delta \) as described above. The special halting state \( q_{\text{halt}} \) has the property that once the machine is in \( q_{\text{halt}} \), the transition function \( \delta \) does not allow it to further modify the tape or change states. Clearly, if the machine enters \( q_{\text{halt}} \) then it has *halted*. In complexity theory we are typically only interested in machines that halt for every input in a finite number of steps.

For calculation part, if \(M\) now is in state \(q\) with \(\Alpha=(\alpha_i)_{i\in[1,k]}\) are the current letters be read on \(k\) tapes and \(\delta(q,\Alpha)=\delta(q',\Beta, t)\) where \(\Beta=(\beta_i)_{i\in[1,k]}\) and \(t\in\{\text{L, S, R}\}^k\), then in next step \(M\) will enter a new state \(q'\) from \(q\) where each word \(\alpha_i\) on the tape is replaced by \(\beta_i\) and the state of the *i*-th head is changed to \(z_i\), namely to **L**eft, **S**tay or to **R**ight.

Some definitions of a Turing machine add additional details to the tuple, like having a limited input alphatable \(\Sigma\supseteq\Gamma\) or an explicit set of accepting state \(A\subseteq Q\). We will include these details as needed.

For the definition of \(Q\), if we allow the Turing machine to do nothing, we do not necessarily need to include an explicit halting state. Instead, we can define the machine to halt if it reaches a state where it does not move its heads, change states or any symbols on the tape. But, it is often convenient to include an explicit halting state \( q_{\text{halt}} \) (with the convention that the machine will not do anything once it reaches this state), or, for machines that accept or reject their input, explicit accepting and rejecting states \( q_{acc} \) and \( q_{rej} \).

### 1.1.2 Complexity
After having the definition of TM, we now can formalize the notion of running time. As every non-trivial algorithm needs to at leastread its entire input, by “quickly” we mean that the number of basic steps we use is small when considered as a function of the input length.

---

*Definition*:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let \( f : \{0,1\}^* \to \{0,1\}^* \) and let \( T : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) be some functions, and let \( M \) be a Turing machine. We say that \( M \) \textit{computes} \( f \) in \( T(n) \)-*time* if for every \( x \in \{0,1\}^* \), if \( M \) is initialized to the start configuration on input \( x \), then after at most \( T(|x|) \) steps it halts with \( f(x) \) written on its output tape.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that \( M \) *computes* \( f \) if it computes \( f \) in \( T(n) \) time for some function \( T : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \).

---

**Remark:** As a convention, we require \(T(n)\geqslant n\) for \(n\) large enough(since we always need time to read the input) and if that computes the function \(x\to\llcorner(T(n))\lrcorner\) in time \(T(n)\) (As usual, \(\llcorner(T(n))\lrcorner\) denotes the binary representation of the number \(T(|x|)\).), we call it *time-constructable*. 

---

### 1.1.3 Robustness
Using this Complexity concept, we may prove our TM with \(k\) heads and tapes is same as simplest TM(i.e. has only 1 head and a tape) up to polynomial time transformation on time and space complexity(and this blow up is inevitabe and worst case will be \(5kT^2(n)\)).
